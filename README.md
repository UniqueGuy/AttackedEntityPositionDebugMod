# AttackedEntityPositionDebugMod
 A useless mod unless you're developing a reach check.
 
 This mod basically just displays the location of the entity you attack.
 This might be useful if you're developing a reach check and you need
 to see where the entity is located on the client side.
 
 Commands /positiondebug (toggles debugging on and off)
